# Kali-theme on Ubuntu (+ switch to XFCE4)

This script will install several components of Kali to make a default Ubuntu-installation look like Kali.
All rights belong to their respective owners.

## Why would you want that?

If you like the Kali-theme (and XFCE4) as your daily driver, but want to use the default Ubuntu packages and repos, this is for you.

## Usage

Note: This script is not perfect, but it works.

Download the contents and place them inside an empty directory.
Now run `main.sh`.

**IMPORTANT:** This removes all GNOME-programs!
